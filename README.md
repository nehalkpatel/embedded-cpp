# Embedded CPP BSP
The purpose of this project is to explore:
1. Using modern C++ and software engineering practices and their applications to embedded systems.
1. Building a host-side simulation and visualization environment.

## C++ Features and SW Engineering Principles
1. Strong types and type-safety
1. Explicit casting and conversion
1. `std::expected` to return values or errors
1. Compile-time checks
1. [Correct-by-construction](https://youtu.be/nLSm3Haxz0I?si=Q-PyVHR4wj7ozaEG)
1. [Separate calculating from doing](https://youtu.be/b4p_tcLYDV0?si=knDDTrq1k3dvHvu0)
